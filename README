README for syntheticMosaic

This is a repo for documentating the synthetic mosaic human DNA sample


Creation and characterisation using ddPCR:
- description from README
- data on oligos and assays: excel spreadsheet
- truth VCF file


WES of sample:
- BAM file at the relevant exons. The BAM file with the 21 positions is only 4.1 MB so should be no problem to place this in the repot.
- Show that the oligos with mutations produce reads in a similar way to WT DNA (IGV screenshot)
- Show that the BAM VAF roughly match the ddPCR VAF. It will be interesting to see whether ampliconSeq or WES obtain the best VAF estimate. A better match between ddPCR and ampliconSeq could be due to the fact that both use amplicon based measurements.


AmpliconSeq of sample: awaiting the second sequencing and Asbjørn analysis.
